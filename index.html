09/06/2013 <p>The song begins to play. So far it seems to sound familiar, as most new songs seem to sound after one study's music for a number of years. Ah, a small tell of delight finds its way to the surface. Dropping into unfamiliar but still somewhat recognizable structure the carefully constructed leads ready the atmosphere for the symphony of cascading voices that trickle down the edge of the structure and soon begin their flow in and out of their destined paths blending with the steady stream of chords with the melodies. As they weave an increasingly intricate pattern the process of analysis goes into overdrive. The mind reals at the questions being asked, for each piece of unfamiliar construction a prediction must be made, what will it sound like next? The urge to follow this through and answer all questions as perceived is something that is hard to ignore. The need for resolution drives the mind to attempt to solve the problem quite relentlessly</p>






 <p><b>09/07/2013</h2></p><p></b>It seems we all possess an unquenchable desire to resolve the unanswered 

question. As the piece comes to its final conclusion one might expect to be in 

a state of something other than an almost desperate anxiety. Here we have a 

perfect example of a problem that is causing a high amount of internal strife. 

Having not yet reached the desired and expected resolution, in this case having 

heard a song that is so original the urge to study the parameters and work with 

them is as strongly ingrained in the psyche as the need to breath is. This 

raises even more questions continueing the constant battle to find more    </p> 
<p><h2>09/10/2013</h2></p>
<p>Let me start by apologizing to my readers for missing few days of posting, 
Hopefully this thought will make up for it. I suspect this will provide a number of different things to a number of different people. Firstly the open minded, let me start by saying a mind that is too exposed may be at real risk of getting stuck in a inescapable loop due to the sheer mania of the thought processes. For the others this text may induce a number of thoughts and or insight into the nature of things. Some may experience a form of deranged enlightenment, others a moment of pondering followed by a moment of regret for having actually put thought into this bizarre and clearly deranged mess of ideas, lastly some may experience an uneasy confusion and subsequent madness induced by the need to follow the rabbit down the hole. I strongly advise against the latter as most humans are simply too large to squeeze through without inflicting serious injury upon themselves. A greater pain was never felt than he who forced his way through the rabbit hole. Trust me, broken colar bones, ribs, fractured hips, and often the loss of a limb or two. Amusingly this fellow hadn't actually attempted to fit through but merely stuck a telescpope down opening, brilliant idea he must have thought. What he hadn't anticipated was that this particular rabbit didn't very much enjoy being proded with a metal rod, especially not during his glowl sorson session on trealop calls. It only happens once for Aberidus Reiltas sake! (yes I speak of the Truth Chesture him loodon)resolutions. Although calling it a battle may be an exaggeration, it does seem to be quite rewarding when the struggle is complete.</p>

A song dries ripe in the august storm something inside wants to reform, leaving the letters to wither and weather they fall to the ground where yearly rebound sprouts delightful delicious beading nutritious bit or a bite ever so bright is the sky or so a dream living a way to better stay. Beginning to crave he lights a stave to tell the story of some wonderful glory found on the hill in the quarry. Growing alright pick it tonight soak the seed in wine. Oh the towers of deprive too wicked a delight growing in the care the keeper seeks his fare. Theres gold in the pool of deep weakened fools leaving in glory without even a story. Unable to share the simplest affair the tools were dulled by the same hands that culled a glory to feel more than whats real, a subtle sign a realign displayed with colors that change one another waves to all looking to fall into the place of souls misplaced. A Phrygian cap perched on my lap set like a flask of the finest cask leaving the home of the old wilted bone tired and blue feeling around I come up found. A moment of this is nothing to miss you’ll see if you climb the endless vine it all will happen to the mishapen as this is the way they sing. Growing in mist weaving the gist leaving behind the thing that finds the place we have to go. Just a thing a many a thing whirling through the patterns lue never a trace of the face which thought he knew colors true but not the thought that leads.</p>

 <p><h2>Inspirations and areas of study 09/13/2013</h2></p>

<p><h2><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl15PlIXHIk">Julian Casablanca, 11th dimention </a></p></h2>

<p>
Excellent performer and entertainer. Music is highly atmospheric and video highly theatrical. Performance art to the highest degree. Focus on techniques of theatre especially regarding blending music, imagery, and possibly the most important aspect the lyrics. It has been my conclusion through studying his performance that the lyrics are a key aspect of creating the atmosphere. Timed correctly body language, the musical harmonies, a high attention and awareness of costume as well as set, and spoken word. It appears if one has the mind to bring all of these aspects together for certain moments of the song in a way that conveys the artists interpretation, expectations, emotions, and projections the atmosphere can be altered to a high degree. It’s not surprising that with the use of four or more variables working in sync with one another can produce such a profound change in one's perception.  Studying this branch of thought further will surely be beneficial in that learning the art of performance, especially musical performance, is a vital and integral part of any musicians abilities.
</p>

<p><b>
The Gorillaz</p></b>
<p>
Superb yet simplistic (although can be complex at times, a few songs in odd 

times, very large and intelligent focus on not only producing solid music but 

entertainment to a degree not touched by most groups.) From their cartoon 

personalities to their tracks written with simply telling a story. Arguably the 

most common form of communication up until the advent of modern communication 

the ability to orally communicate a sequence of events and consequences was 

often the key role and only method of learning important things. The art of 

storytelling, whether it be sung, spoken, or drawn is an invaluable method of 

communicating to your audience. The Gorillaz seem to be the epitome of this.
</p>

<p><h2>
Tech 9</h2>
</p>

<p>
What more can I say they are simply amazing, lyrically, rhythmically, musically, 

hard to find a better at what they do. I've spent many a night studying, 

recreating, and trying to learn as much as I can from this group.
</p><p>"People perceive you to be lethal when you ain't see through like tissue."</p><p>With lyrics like these it's no wonder they've been such a success. From studying tech I've learned that killer lyrics are a vital part to any excellent song with a well build atmosphere. </p><p>Well thought out, intelligent, out of the box, amazing lyrics. It’s in this area that my work is focused, without lyrics people care about you just have some nice sounding noise. To gain that extra dimension that’s such an integral part of any successful musicians abilities they must master the art of the language.
</p>

<p><b>Paul Simon</b></p>

<p>This guy knew how music was supposed to be made, a true musician if I've ever 

heard one. If there was ever someone to study the music of this is the guy. A 

quote from an interview regarding his songwriting method "The music always 

precedes the words. The words often come from the sound of the music and 

eventually evolve into coherent thoughts. Or incoherent thoughts. Rhythm plays 

a crucial part in the lyric-making as well. It’s like a puzzle to find the 
right words to express what the music is saying."
While my method of songwriting doesn't always follow this formula I often find 

that when not actively planning and constructing a song it often naturally 

finds it's way through these steps. After a few setbacks involving the extended 

planning of a song that was, well, much too extended, I have leaned more toward 

Pauls method. So far it's a time saving and idea forming miracle. It allows the 
ideas to come to me while I'm working on the other parts of the song that are 

more obvious. I feel as if I've cut my songwriting time almost in half after 

taking this advice to heart.
<P>

<h2><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VQ_3sBZEm0">Foo Fighters </a></h2></P><P>
Have always enjoyed the art from this group but didn't fully appreciate it 

until I recently discovered a song of theirs called Learn to Fly. It blew me 

away, there are not a lot of pop songs being created by pop artists in ODD 

TIMINGS. I'm not saying 4/4 is something that shouldn't be done or is 

necessarily overdone but pop artists could broaden their range of time 

signatures quite a bit more than they are. I believe creating a song in a long 

time (15/8) and have it be odd creates a sort of swing, if done correctly, 

which is almost intoxicating in its listening pleasurability. If you're having 

trouble understanding what I mean or simply are unaware of what time signatures 

are just listen to a few of these songs I've gathered that are in odd times (in 

addition to the foo fighters link above.) See if you can figure out the time 

signature on your own, or if you don't know how listen carefully and see if you 

can hear the difference between these and other pop songs in common 4/4 time

(choose any pop song and it's likely to be 4/4).

</p><p><h2><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GimLuOUVkxg">Solsbury Hill</a></p></h2>

This song... I can hardly put into words how much I enjoy this song. It has 

atmosphere, subtle yet amazing aspects of theatre, and most importantly a song 

that I would argue has few equals.

</p><p><h2><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e03cdj5sS2E">Dream Theatre, Learning to Live</a></p></h2>
<p>
As far as technicality and time signature variations go these guys are where 

it's at. Who can deny their greatness? I surely can't, not a day goes by 

listening to their songs where I don't feel as if I've learned something new.
</p>

<p>

<h2><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrLF4HymAs4">Sting, I Was Brought To My Senses</a></p></h2>
<p>

Admittedly I haven't listened to as much of these guys as I feel I need to. 

Excellent musicians not afraid to break the common patterns. This group is 

currently in my list of studies. I'm sure there is much to learn, I anticipate 

my further studies of this group to yield quite a high amount of insight into 

the nature of pop music.
</p>

<p>

I will continue to update this list as my studies evolve. If you know of any songs (preferably pop but don't hesitate to send others) that are in odd timings I encourage you to let me know. I can be reached on my twitter account listed on the side menu. Really anything that one might consider a learning opportunity I will eagerly follow. Don't know any songs in odd timing? Perfectly ok, let me know your favorite, there's always something to learn.
