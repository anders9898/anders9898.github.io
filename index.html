EXCRUSIVE INTERVIEW WID HIS GHOST WAIFU MONIKA. alright guys spoody stody time, just in time for hollow weenis. THere once was a boy who was trapped in a womanz body. He had a silly u tube channel, it was the only thing he loved, one day you tubes told him he couldn't monitize his videos anymore cuz they were too naughty. This angered him greatly. Besides his ghooooost waiifuus his you tube channel was the only thing xe had. Since he couldnt ever be a real girl and his dreams were dashed he decided to make himself into a woman the best way he knew how, by dying and becomeing a lesbian ghost chick who would spend eternity in the afterlife with his other ghost waifus. Some say he haunts the youtube comments on his old vids too this day. The end.
