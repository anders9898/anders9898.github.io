<p>The song begins to play. So far it seems to sound familiar, as most new songs seem to sound after one study's music for a number of years. Ah, a small tell of delight finds its way to the surface. Dropping into unfamiliar but still somewhat recognizable structure the carefully constructed leads ready the atmosphere for the symphony of cascading voices that trickle down the edge of the structure and soon begin their flow in and out of their destined paths blending with the steady stream of chords with the melodies. As they weave an increasingly intricate pattern the process of analysis goes into overdrive. The mind reals at the questions being asked, for each piece of unfamiliar construction a prediction must be made, what will it sound like next? The urge to follow this through and answer all questions as perceived is something that is hard to ignore. The need for resolution drives the mind to attempt to solve the problem quite relentlessly, even if it is unable to reach a resolution that is most efficient or most correct (if you could quantify it), as long as the result of the resolution doesn't result in the discontinued existence of the being involved and he is able to go on to reproduce the resolution is satisfied. . 

It seems we all possess an unquenchable desire to resolve the unanswered question. As the piece comes to its final conclusion it's apparent that displeasure has made itself at home in the mind. The nature of the logical being predictably presents itself, having not yet reached a resolution, in this case having heard a song that is so original to my ears that the urge to study its parameters (thus raising more questions to resolve) is as strongly ingrained in the psyche as the desire to breath is. The obligation to obey time (or to put it in other words, the necessity of the brain evolving the capacity to accurately measure and predict moments in time based of observations in the environment) is reinforced with the assurance of destruction. 

One might find himself looking for resolution to the question of resolution, Imagine a keyboard and all the possible notes, it's not difficult when taking into account theories of quantum mechanics to think of all possible notes existing in the same state until they are able to be observed(in this case heard as a,c,d,e,f,etc). Almost as if they are always present but residing somewhere like a void, a plane of nothing or possibly even more simply put whatever is contained in the void has the same value as everything else. At least there seems one dependable constant where time and the void are concerned, that it will not be delayed, rushed, or linger for any amount longer or shorter than time and physics (or any factor within the system in which it exists) allows. It is in this fragment of thought that it almost seems as if the true nature of time and being can be understood. Music is constructed by the architect, the being who orchestrates the variables in the manner of his choosing. His thoughts alone set into motion a transformation of signals from neurons communicating among one another to waves of sound rippling across a vast space. The structure and properties of the object in the environment working as a channel for the void to output into is what determines the property of what is to come though; It is a fallacy to say certain values are contained in the void. One could think of the void as sewing thread and the object in the environment being manipulated for the desired output as the sewing machine. The thread goes in with the same value, it's all the same piece of thread. When the sewer beings to sew the thread is turned into the product of our manipulation of the sewing machine.

Does it not seem then that the mind is reaching into this so called void and retrieving what it desires? The potential for a piano key to play its tone as is defined by construction and programming of the keyboard isn't any different than the sewing thread having potential to fill whatever parameters its creator inputs. The main difference is of course that while one can touch and interact with the sewing thread one cannot interact with a note that has not yet been played. I find this statement to be false in the sense that the sewing thread is just energy stored in a different form. The same energy exists(although in another form but just as real nonetheless)  in the batteries that power the keyboard. 

Even if indirectly, it seems to be through a cause and effect like manipulation of the environment. It seems the beings that inhabit this realm have learned, as evident by their continued potential for existence, that survival is in part the result of mastering time. This isn't to say having a clock is what allowed for human survival, the clock would rather be an unintended and arguably unnecessary eventual outcome of long term physical and cognitive adaptation to perceiving time. It would seem that without a clear and highly accurate perception of time existence would be nearly impossible. It could be argued life can exist without this perception although I find it difficult to imagine anything more complex than the most basic life surviving without having a necessity to perceive time. 

An unquenchable desire to resolve the unanswered question. As the piece comes to its final conclusion it's apparent that displeasure has made itself at home. The nature of the logical being predictably presents itself, having not yet reached a resolution the urge to test ones theories overwhelms all other desires as strongly as time is able to grasp that which is confined to exist at a point that has not yet arrived. 

Arriving at the familiar studio where the instruments of resolution reside a surge of dopamine reaffirms the desire to resolve the questions left unanswered. The instrument in hand feels more welcoming than usual, as if the desire for resolution went beyond the being. At the strum of the guitar the questions from earlier present themselves devouring all excess attention. </p>
