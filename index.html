<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/vincenthallx/stepoddly">My Indiegogo Campaign</a></p><p>The hysteria in which the mind functions to overcome certain absurd but necessary leaps in logic is both exhausting and exhilarating. If one has been convinced to read further please, don't, for the good of one's sanity. Now if one has considered closing the page as to not indulge himself in the surely absurd, deranged, possibly psychotic, and most probably inane writings below then I implore you to continue reading. It's the apathetic mind that is capable of peering across the threshold of the system and all its familiar patterns. The mind that does not care or cares little is magnificently qualified to examine the areas that occupy the absence of all things.
<p>It's much more likely that it will simply confuse, as I'm not entirely sure I make any sense. </p>

<p>It's more of an artistic writing, avant garde meets philosophy? </p>

<p>Possible, or it's entirely possible I've fallen to a bout of  depraved madness </p>

<p>I'll let the reader be the judge.</p></p>

        <p><center> </p><p>09/10/2013</p><p>Let me start by apologizing to my readers for missing a day of posting, 
Hopefully this thought will make up for it. I suspect this will provide a number of different things to a number of different people. Firstly the open minded, let me start by saying a mind that is too exposed may be at real risk of getting stuck in a inescapable loop due to the sheer mania of the thought processes. For the others this text may induce a number of thoughts and or insight into the nature of things. Some may experience a form of deranged enlightenment, others a moment of pondering followed by a moment of regret for having actually put thought into this bizarre and clearly deranged mess of ideas, lastly some may experience an uneasy confusion and subsequent madness induced by the need to follow the rabbit down the hole. I strongly advise against the latter as most humans are simply too large to squeeze through without inflicting serious injury upon themselves. A greater pain was never felt than he who forced his way through the rabbit hole. Trust me, broken colar bones, ribs, fractured hips, and often the loss of a limb or two. Amusingly this fellow hadn't actually attempted to fit through but merely stick a seeing glass down there, brilliant idea he must have thought. What he hadn't anticipated was that this particular rabbit didn't very much enjoy being proded with a metal rod, especially not during his glowl sorson session on trealop time. It only happens once a ulind for Aberidus Reiltas  sake! (yes I speak of the Truth Chesture him loodon(<-self)) This has been your cautionary advisory regarding todays hurricane of reflective, speculative, and most probably disturbed barrage of unhealthy and most definitely sertaved thoughts.</p>

<p>09/07/2013</p>It seems we all possess an unquenchable desire to resolve the unanswered 

question. As the piece comes to its final conclusion one might expect to be in 

a state of something other than an almost desperate anxiety. Here we have a 

perfect example of a problem that is causing a high amount of internal strife. 

Having not yet reached the desired and expected resolution, in this case having 

heard a song that is so original the urge to study theparameters and work with 

them is as strongly ingrained in the psyche as the need to breath is. This 

raises even more questions continueing the constant battle to find more 

resolutions. Although calling it a battle may be an exaggeration, it does seem 

to be quite rewarding when the struggle is complete.</o>

<p>The song begins to play. So far it seems to sound familiar, as most new songs seem to sound after one study's music for a number of years. Ah, a small tell of delight finds its way to the surface. Dropping into unfamiliar but still somewhat recognizable structure the carefully constructed leads ready the atmosphere for the symphony of cascading voices that trickle down the edge of the structure and soon begin their flow in and out of their destined paths blending with the steady stream of chords with the melodies. As they weave an increasingly intricate pattern the process of analysis goes into overdrive. The mind reals at the questions being asked, for each piece of unfamiliar construction a prediction must be made, what will it sound like next? The urge to follow this through and answer all questions as perceived is something that is hard to ignore. The need for resolution drives the mind to attempt to solve the problem quite relentlessly</p></center>
