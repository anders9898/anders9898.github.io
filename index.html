<p>09/07/2013</p>It seems we all possess an unquenchable desire to resolve the unanswered 

question. As the piece comes to its final conclusion one might expect to be in 

a state of something other than an almost desperate anxiety. Here we have a 

perfect example of a problem that is causing a high amount of internal strife. 

Having not yet reached the desired and expected resolution, in this case having 

heard a song that is so original the urge to study theparameters and work with 

them is as strongly ingrained in the psyche as the need to breath is. This 

raises even more questions continueing the constant battle to find more 

resolutions. Although calling it a battle may be an exaggeration, it does seem 

to be quite rewarding when the struggle is complete.</o>

<p>The song begins to play. So far it seems to sound familiar, as most new songs seem to sound after one study's music for a number of years. Ah, a small tell of delight finds its way to the surface. Dropping into unfamiliar but still somewhat recognizable structure the carefully constructed leads ready the atmosphere for the symphony of cascading voices that trickle down the edge of the structure and soon begin their flow in and out of their destined paths blending with the steady stream of chords with the melodies. As they weave an increasingly intricate pattern the process of analysis goes into overdrive. The mind reals at the questions being asked, for each piece of unfamiliar construction a prediction must be made, what will it sound like next? The urge to follow this through and answer all questions as perceived is something that is hard to ignore. The need for resolution drives the mind to attempt to solve the problem quite relentlessly</p></center>
