If one has been convinced to read further please, don't, for the good of one's sanity. Now if one has considered closing the page as to not indulge himself in the surely absurd, deranged, possibly psychotic, and most probably inane writings below then I implore you to continue reading. It's the apathetic mind that is capable of peering across the threshold of the system and all its familiar patterns. The mind that does not care or cares little is magnificently qualified to examine the areas that occupy the absence of all things.\r\n</p>09/06/2013 <p>The song begins to play. So far it seems to sound familiar, as most new songs seem to sound after one study's music for a number of years. Ah, a small tell of delight finds its way to the surface. Dropping into unfamiliar but still somewhat recognizable structure the carefully constructed leads ready the atmosphere for the symphony of cascading voices that trickle down the edge of the structure and soon begin their flow in and out of their destined paths blending with the steady stream of chords with the melodies. As they weave an increasingly intricate pattern the process of analysis goes into overdrive. The mind reals at the questions being asked, for each piece of unfamiliar construction a prediction must be made, what will it sound like next? The urge to follow this through and answer all questions as perceived is something that is hard to ignore. The need for resolution drives the mind to attempt to solve the problem quite relentlessly</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n <p>09/07/2013</p>It seems we all possess an unquenchable desire to resolve the unanswered \r\n\r\nquestion. As the piece comes to its final conclusion one might expect to be in \r\n\r\na state of something other than an almost desperate anxiety. Here we have a \r\n\r\nperfect example of a problem that is causing a high amount of internal strife. \r\n\r\nHaving not yet reached the desired and expected resolution, in this case having \r\n\r\nheard a song that is so original the urge to study the parameters and work with \r\n\r\nthem is as strongly ingrained in the psyche as the need to breath is. This \r\n\r\nraises even more questions continueing the constant battle to find more     \r\n<p>09/10/2013</p>\r\n<p>Let me start by apologizing to my readers for missing few days of posting, \r\nHopefully this thought will make up for it. I suspect this will provide a number of different things to a number of different people. Firstly the open minded, let me start by saying a mind that is too exposed may be at real risk of getting stuck in a inescapable loop due to the sheer mania of the thought processes. For the others this text may induce a number of thoughts and or insight into the nature of things. Some may experience a form of deranged enlightenment, others a moment of pondering followed by a moment of regret for having actually put thought into this bizarre and clearly deranged mess of ideas, lastly some may experience an uneasy confusion and subsequent madness induced by the need to follow the rabbit down the hole. I strongly advise against the latter as most humans are simply too large to squeeze through without inflicting serious injury upon themselves. A greater pain was never felt than he who forced his way through the rabbit hole. Trust me, broken colar bones, ribs, fractured hips, and often the loss of a limb or two. Amusingly this fellow hadn't actually attempted to fit through but merely stick a seeing glass down there, brilliant idea he must have thought. What he hadn't anticipated was that this particular rabbit didn't very much enjoy being proded with a metal rod, especially not during his glowl sorson session on trealop time. It only happens once a ulind for Aberidus Reiltas  sake! (yes I speak of the Truth Chesture him loodon(\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\nresolutions. Although calling it a battle may be an exaggeration, it does seem \r\n\r\nto be quite rewarding when the struggle is complete.\r\n\r\n\r\n <p>09/12/2013</p><p>\r\nA song dries ripe in the august storm something inside wants to reform, leaving the letters to wither and weather they fall to the ground where yearly rebound sprouts delightful delicious beading nutritious bit or a bite ever so bright is the sky or so a dream living a way to better stay. Beginning to crave he lights a stave to tell the story of some wonderful glory found on the hill in the quarry. Growing alright pick it tonight soak the seed in wine. Oh the towers of deprive too wicked a delight growing in the care the keeper seeks his fare. Theres gold in the pool of deep weakened fools leaving in glory without even a story. Unable to share the simplest affair the tools were dulled by the same hands that culled a glory to feel more than it should, a subtle sign a realign displayed with colors that change one another and then waves to all looking to fall into the place of things reborn. A Phrygian cap perched on my lap set like a flask of the finest cask leaving the home of the tired and blue feeling the sound I come up true. A moment of this is nothing to miss you’ll see if you climb the endless suns shine it all just happens to be at the tree who is an endless fog. Growing in mist weaving the whisp leaving behind the thing that finds tall thoughts that are not in place of the knot. Just a thing a many a thing whirling through the patterns lue never a trace of the race which thought they knew colors true but not the thought that leads to the lot of things to know by the end of the show.\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n <p>Inspirations and areas of study 09/12/2013</p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl15PlIXHIk\">Julian Casablanca, 11th dimention </a>\r\n<p>\r\nexcellent performer and entertainer. Music is highly atmospheric and video highly theatrical. Performance art to the highest degree. Focus on techniques of theatre especially regarding blending music, imagery, and possibly the most important aspect the lyrics. It has been my conclusion through studying his performance that the lyrics are a key aspect of creating the atmosphere. Timed correctly body language, the musical harmonies, a high attention and awareness of costume as well as set, and spoken word. It appears if one has the mind to bring all of these aspects together for certain moments of the song in a way that conveys the artists interpretation, expectations, emotions, and projections the atmosphere can be altered to a high degree. It’s not surprising that with the use of four or more variables working in sync with one another can produce such a profound change in one's perception.  Studying this branch of thought further will surely be beneficial in that learning the art of performance, especially musical performance, is a vital and integral part of any musicians abilities.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Gorillaz</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSuperb yet simplistic (although can be complex at times, a few songs in odd \r\n\r\ntimes, very large and intelligent focus on not only producing solid music but \r\n\r\nentertainment to a degree not touched by most groups.) From their cartoon \r\n\r\npersonalities to their tracks written with simply telling a story. Arguably the \r\n\r\nmost common form of communication up until the advent of modern communication \r\n\r\nthe ability to orally communicate a sequence of events and consequences was \r\n\r\noften the key role and only method of learning important things. The art of \r\n\r\nstorytelling, whether it be sung, spoken, or drawn is an invaluable method of \r\n\r\ncommunicating to your audience. The Gorillaz seem to be the epitome of this.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTech 9\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhat more can I say they are simply amazing, lyrically, rhythmically, musically, \r\n\r\nhard to find a better at what they do. I've spent many a night studying, \r\n\r\nrecreating, and trying to learn as much as I can from this group.\r\n<p>People perceive you to be lethal when you ain't see through like tissue</p><p>With lyrics like these it's no wonder they’re so successful. If these guys have taught me anything it’s that killer lyrics are a key part to any excellent song. Well thought out, intelligent, out of the box, amazing lyrics. It’s in this area that my work is focused, without lyrics people care about you just have some nice sounding noise. To gain that extra dimension that’s such an integral part of any successful musicians abilities they must master the art of the language.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paul Simon</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This man knew how music was supposed to be made, a true musician if I've ever \r\n\r\nheard one. If there was ever someone to study the music of this is the guy. A \r\n\r\nquote from an interview regarding his songwriting method \"The music always \r\n\r\nprecedes the words. The words often come from the sound of the music and \r\n\r\neventually evolve into coherent thoughts. Or incoherent thoughts. Rhythm plays \r\n\r\na crucial part in the lyric-making as well. It’s like a puzzle to find the \r\nright words to express what the music is saying.\"\r\nWhile my method of songwriting doesn't always follow this formula I often find \r\n\r\nthat when not actively planning and constructing a song it often naturally \r\n\r\nfinds it's way through these steps. After a few setbacks involving the extended \r\n\r\nplanning of a song that was, well, much too extended, I have leaned more toward \r\n\r\nPauls method. So far it's a time saving and idea forming miracle. It allows the \r\nideas to come to me while I'm working on the other parts of the song that are \r\n\r\nmore obvious. I feel as if I've cut my songwriting time almost in half after \r\n\r\ntaking this advice to heart.<\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\r\nFoo Fighters  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VQ_3sBZEm0\r\nHave always enjoyed the art from this group but didn't fully appreciate it \r\n\r\nuntil I recently discovered a song of theirs called Learn to Fly. It blew me \r\n\r\naway, there are not a lot of pop songs being created by pop artists in ODD \r\n\r\nTIMINGS. I'm not saying 4/4 is something that shouldn't be done or is \r\n\r\nnecessarily overdone but pop artists could broaden their range of time \r\n\r\nsignatures quite a bit more than they are. I believe creating a song in a long \r\n\r\ntime (15/8) and have it be odd creates a sort of swing, if done correctly, \r\n\r\nwhich is almost intoxicating in its listening pleasurability. If you're having \r\n\r\ntrouble understanding what I mean or simply are unaware of what time signatures \r\n\r\nare just listen to a few of these songs I've gathered that are in odd times (in \r\n\r\naddition to the foo fighters link above.) See if you can figure out the time \r\n\r\nsignature on your own, or if you don't know how listen carefully and see if you \r\n\r\ncan hear the difference between these and other pop songs in common 4/4 time\r\n\r\n(choose any pop song and it's likely to be 4/4).\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GimLuOUVkxg\">Solsbury Hill</a></p>\r\n\r\nThis song... I can hardly put into words how much I enjoy this song. It has \r\n\r\natmosphere, subtle yet amazing aspects of theatre, and most importantly a song \r\n\r\nthat I would argue has few equals.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Inspirations and studies continued 09/13/2013</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e03cdj5sS2E\">Dream Theatre, Learning to Live</a></p></p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs far as technicality and time signature variations go these guys are where \r\n\r\nit's at. Who can deny their greatness? I surely can't, not a day goes by \r\n\r\nlistening to their songs where I don't feel as if I've learned something new.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrLF4HymAs4\">Sting, I Was Brought To My Senses</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nAdmittedly I haven't listened to as much of these guys as I feel I need to. \r\n\r\nExcellent musicians not afraid to break the common patterns. This group is \r\n\r\ncurrently in my list of studies. I'm sure there is much to learn, I anticipate \r\n\r\nmy further studies of this group to yield quite a high amount of insight into \r\n\r\nthe nature of pop music.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nI will continue to update this list as my studies evolve. If you know of any songs (preferably pop but don't hesitate to send others) that are in odd timings I encourage you to let me know. I can be reached on my twitter account listed on the side menu. Really anything that one might consider a learning opportunity I will eagerly follow. Don't know any songs in odd timing? Perfectly ok, let me know your favorite, there's always something to learn.\r\n</p>\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
